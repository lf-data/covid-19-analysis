# Analysis and prediction of stringency index based on data about the Covid-19 spread
*gen 2021 â€“ mar 2021*

I used a dataset of covid-19 spread from "Our World in Data" to predict, check, and get analysis about the stringency index (the level of closure activity in a country) based on the covid-19 data.
I made this project using R programming language and some R libraries.
